And that got me thinking about Nina Simone as a kind of an image as an overpowering image of my girlhood. My best girlfriend mursaleen. And I really did have an incident where her sister came into the bedroom and found us messing with her stuff, and said to us, if we wanted to be so grounded, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And so the story about the Nina Simone concert, sparked a series of memories about moments in time, when Nina Simone as a kind of iconic figure, sort of rose to the fore in a in what seemed a very personal way. And so that was how the poem started, it really did sort of bring back those kinds of memories of experiences.",

Because they are in fact there. And because they're part and parcel of the community, they are part of who we are. And so I think it's just an indication of an age at a time and a sense of what makes sense of what is right. It's only when we look back later, that it seems that we've committed some some great error, some great sin, as it were, and but she becomes in the poem far more symbolic of that entire tendency. But I mean, if you think of popular singers, and how popular singers go in and out of Vogue, and in and out of style, that kind of thing happens all the time. What was different about Nina Simone was that she represented an era. And my sense is that she knew that she represented that era. And there was a certain kind of cooperation and participation that was expected of all of the rest of us. And my sense, I have a very strong sense that we did not hold up our end of the bargain, but that perhaps there was no way for us to know that until it was too late anyway. And so the poem is a poem about regret. But it's regret about a situation that really can't be changed. And maybe the tone is not so much regret, as as it says it's a kind of recounting a kind of telling to play back against those other images. When we when, when we in fact, were all the evening news. And it's an attempt to capture not maybe not one era, but a series of eras. And Nina Simone seems to be present throughout she seems now to have been a constant. And the poem is a sense of our of a kind of communal regret personalized with the speaker takes on the confessional attitude of the group of a community of a [?]",

        "value": "BMO: I come from a place where sugar is very important. Louisiana was a sugar state. And the portion of the poem that I read, it's a rather long poem. And I read an excerpt from it. And so that portion is the introduction to the topic of sugar. And much later in the poem, there's all this stuff about the processing of sugar, and the growing of sugar and all of this stuff. But it also, there are a series of plays on that word sugar, and the many ways that we use it, we call one another sugar, and so forth. And the poem is an attempt to, to look at the paradox of this sweet sticky substance, that is also the source of rum, the intoxicating substance, and that that seems to say so much about our experience in the New World, sugar was one of the reasons we were here. And we produce sugar, and we consume sugar. And when we are ill with diabetes, we say that we have sugar. And we call one another sugar. And we sugarcoat things. And in a city like New Orleans, of course, one of the things we're famous for is pastries, and sweets. And we have all kinds of names for various kinds of sweet, sweet, sweet goods and sweet foods. And one of the ones that is typical of New Orleans is hot calas, and calas or rice cakes, which of course, there's a double meaning there because we also were rice area, Louisiana was rather than Orleans and so rice and sugar together, compounding of the experience of the enslaved and oppressed. And also, there's a lot of bodily imagery in the poem, because of course, this is intense backbreaking labor. And so the poem is an attempt to look at not just at slavery, but at enslavement as a specific kind of violence as a specific kind of action, and to personalize it in a way that perhaps makes sense to us. One of the one of my firmest beliefs is that no one ever thought of herself as a slave. That slave was not anyone's name or job title or, or any other such thing that that people were persons first in their own mind's eye and their own imagination prior to anything else. And so in the poem, I create a series of characters who speak. And it's called a cautionary cautionary fabulous cautionary tale. The title is and the title is, how to make sugar, a cautionary fabulous grid small. So one of the things that the point does is it appropriates the colonial and colonizing voice, the dehumanizing voice, but writing against that constantly, and I think the authoritative voice in the poem is the voice of the woman who speaks and who is spoken about and who has written about and who is unreachable, unattainable and who remains removed from all of this, and backing her up, I suppose, are the women who are called the vendeurs, the sellers and their marketplace, scenes and so forth in which the women are observed and observe others observing them. So it's a poem about representation, and a point about the making of a series of images and the whole sensual passage about the tying  of the []. And how important that is and how it attaches to the free status of these particular women who are going to use I think is an important point to make that even within the free black community. There is this obsession with containment and tying and burdening the difference there is that the vendeurs these free black women are doing their own form of containment and tying their heads are tied in these sumptuous cloths. There's a passage later on in the poem that I didn't read, that talks about how they layer their ankles in gold and silver bracelets because this represents their freedom, oddly enough. And so it's a poem about the making, of an image and perhaps the remaking and the reconstituting of a self against such incredible odds, I think I could be wrong.",

        "value": "BMO: Uh hm, I think it's the most important thing about about the work I do is that it's it, it all grows out of an attempt to understand something about New Orleans. One of the things that growing up in New Orleans does is it gives you a sense of an essentially intact cultural environment. And of a cultural environment that is its own thing that clearly is African American, but is African American in its own rather specific and improvised upon and constantly improvising way. And so I've spent most of my writing life, studying New Orleans, studying the African presence in New Orleans, studying traditional religion in New Orleans. As a way of understanding something about perspective, I suppose something about perspective, something about shape, something about how things are made. Because the poem, I love the word poetry, the word poem poesis is the main thing, it is a thing that is made that is constructed that has its own entity in the world, once it is made, it's a part for me. And it's no longer mine. And it stands out there, if it's any good, it stands out there on its own, without me to support it. And so I think that something about New Orleans, something about the specific history of slavery endured there, something about the very specific kinds of resistance, something about our peculiar dance forms, things like the second line, things like hot calas, the bending of form, the recreating, and the fracturing of form and space and time, a kind of disbelief even in time that history is into the past, history is what happens. And so history is acting in us, we're acting in it. And we were acting upon it all of the time, that it's always all going on. And that's the beauty of the dance that we call second line, that while the primary procession is taking place, the formal procession is taking place. There, there's this band, or rather, there are multiple bands of people gathered along the side, who are doing these other things. And each time they do the other thing, it takes a different form, nobody dances, the second line exactly the same way twice. There's certain basic steps, certain basic movements, and you do countless variations on those. And the beauty of the thing is that somehow, we all can do it, I don't know any New Orleanians, who can't do it, we all can do it. We all recognize it when we see it. And yet we all do it differently. We know what is and is not second line. But it's always changing. It's constantly changing. And so everything is always happening. And it isn't an a-historical approach. It's probably a multi-layered approach to history as a thing from within, as opposed to a thing imposed from without. And that's the thing is that I have a fascination with history. And I have a fascination with poets who have a problem with history. And I think some of our greatest poets, certainly some of our greatest narrative poets have a problem with history. And that is the thing that makes that makes them so compelling. Robert Hayden has a problem with history. And so he writes in history, in order to work out these narrative moments and to make them real to us. Gail Jones has a problem with history. And she's always rediscovering it and reshaping it. Sherley Anne Williams has a problem with history and our long narrative points. Jay Wright has a problem with history. And so history becomes the problem. It becomes the thing that you look at the thing that you worry, the thing that you finger, it's the scab, it's the sore, and you work around it constantly. It's always there. And it never quite goes away. It's never finished. And therefore neither are we. So that we're constantly working and it isn't so much revising, as it is revisioning. That we have to learn to see history in our own image, so to speak. We have to, I think, learn and we have to teach ourselves over and over again. What are history really is, and what our place is in our history, or histories.",

On the one hand, it's quite open, you can do all kinds of things, you could have a multitude of narrative and lyric voices happening in there. Recently, I've been experimenting with rhyme in the long poem. And it's an open form. And yet, at the same time, it's a form that breaks certain boundaries, in a very conscientious way. When we think of narrative, I think it's common to think of a story with a beginning, middle and end. And yet, if you look at truly fine narrative poems, that doesn't exist in truly fine narratives, narrative poems. In Robert Hayden's Middle Passage, for instance, there is not a beginning, middle and end, we begin in the middle or at the end, we can't tell which it is, it depends on on who's actually reading the poem. But we have snippets and passages and excerpts of things, of documents, of things that's both support and critique reality. And because we have all of that laid bare for us, it's like walking into a room where we have the option to rearrange everything, each time we enter the room. Or perhaps each time we enter the room, we see the room as a different environment, and we organize it to suit our purposes for that moment. So that the point exists in a kind of moment.

I was raised in a tradition that believes very much in the whole in the whole in the beauty of the whole, that a thing is good, when it is beautiful thing is beautiful, when it is whole, that wholeness and beauty and health all go together, those are all the same thing. And so on the one hand, I was brought up in a tradition that that holds very dearly to that principle. And yet at the same time, the poems that I write, are by nature, fragmentary. And purposely fragmenting the scene, or the character or the speaker, or the narrative or the image. There are lots of images of broken things, and sometimes stanzas seem to end. at a point where nothing has actually happened, something might be about to happen. But we don't know yet what that is, and we don't find out in that poem. So that we get bits and pieces. And the thing is, it isn't the story that's important is the thing that eventually, we begin to realize as readers, it isn't the story that matters in the narrative poem. It's how the story is being told why the story is being told. And who are the voices telling these stories? And do we trust them? Do we know them? Are they us? So it's, it's, it's about possibilities, I think, much more so than about that about the story itself. And I think that's a major difference between the writing of prose fiction, and the writing of the narrative poem, that the purpose is different. My purpose is never to tell a story. When I start out. What happens is that I come across a story I find a story or a story finds me and I find it compelling in some way. And try to see how many ways I can approach that story and how many versions or voices that story might exist in and sometimes within the same character within the same narrative within the same narrator. There might be multiple voices going on too.",

And so I've never seen my work as belonging to a particular movement. I do see that it belongs in a certain moment, though. But those are really questions I suppose to be determined later after the passage of much time. But I do see African American poetry, attempting to acquire a new freshness, a new kind of experimentation with language that is perhaps not quite so reverent, as it once was, that there is a newly awakened sense of play, and a newly awakened sense of and when I talk about play, I'm talking about taking a kind of joy in the language and seeing the language as the instrument that it is. So that there is not such an awe of the beauty of language that we can also toy with the ugliness of language. And that we can represent horrible things in beautiful language is one of the most shocking. One of the most shocking things. I think it happens in prose fiction quite a lot as well. There's that beautiful passage in Toni Morrison's Beloved where Sethe is attempting to behead her child because the slavers are coming. And it's one of the most beautiful passages, I think, in the English language. And there is a kind of holy, quiet, that surrounds that moment. That's the moment of poetry. That's the stuff that we that we hold to and clinging to embrace. And yet the act is so horrible, that we are able to see a kind of beauty.",

        "value": "BMO: I would say I have an obsession with language [laughter] and languages and, and that I collect language and languages, I suppose in the way that that other people collect objects. And it goes back pretty far, I suppose. I've always had a fascination with language and with languages, because something tells me that, that there's always something in there, there's always some possibility in there. And of course, there are things that we can express in certain languages that we can't express in other languages there. Finally, there are things that are that are non-translatable. There's no French word for gumbo. Because the concept doesn't exist because the experience doesn't exist because the ingredients don't exist. [laughter] So you make it as best you possibly can in this other environment, but you have to call it gumbo. That's what it is. And and yet, there's a layering that takes place there. There's a layering of experience, and the layering of language. And one of the things that fascinates me about black folk, wherever we find them is the extent to which we have always joyed in language. We're a tongue people. We believe in loose tongues and free tongues. And one of the things that I think it's very easy to forget nowadays with the 21st century, one of the things that's very easy to forget, is that we came to the new world as a multilingual people. And we've perhaps lost or discarded languages along the way. And I think there's a kind of imperative that we make some attempt to reclaim some of those languages, as best we possibly can. And to embrace language. And language is one of those things that's, of course, always been used against us as a tool as a weapon. And it's the kind of thing that we've always embraced and said, A perfect example of that is Creole language. You take the masters' language, which might be French or Spanish or Portuguese or Dutch. And you say this is your language. This is the language of the master. This is the language in which you control me. This is the language in which you turn me into an abject object. This is the language in which you disagree. May, I will show you what I can do with your language, I will give it back to you in this fractured, twisted form. And you tell me, can you understand what I'm doing with this language now? Can you speak this language. And of course, the reality is that you find very few people who are not born into a creole speaking environment, who speak those languages and understand those languages. And even when we translate those languages into our use of English, which certainly is what happens in a place like Louisiana, you find us coming up with these newly concocted arrangements of language in turn, turns of phrase, and, and that's the thing I think, where we find beauty in the language is it's the turn of phrase. It isn't the funny spellings of, of plantation dialect. And poets who use black folk speech, we're never really tried to do plantation dialect that was imposed from the exterior, they were trying to capture the authenticity, of black skill, the ability to improvise and to make language to make words. And finally, that's what poetry is really all about. More so I think that all of the other literary art forms, poetry is lodged in language, and you have to go through the language, there is no other way. If it doesn't exist in the poem, if it doesn't exist in the text, then it ain't there. And you can't, you can't put it there, you have to enter the poem through the language. And part of what that means is that you have to be able to enter the poets world.",

Huge gap, there's a huge gap there, the audience listening to the poem, seeing the poem, hearing, the poem being performed, understands the poem grasps the poem responds to the poem in the moment. And that's a wonderful thing to be a part of, that one of the best things about poetry is the live poetry reading. Because there's a kind of energy that takes place, there's something that passes between the poet and the audience, when it's working. [laughter] Everything is going well, there's this energy that passes back and forth between the poet and the audience. And we feed on that it's a mutual thing. That doesn't necessarily happen with the critic. It doesn't necessarily happen. Because there's this attempt to impose this order from outside.

But each reading of the poem is going to be different than every other reading of the poem, a poem like the Nina Simone poem. There are occasions where I will read it with more or less verve with more or less bounce with more or less volume, with more or less emphasis on certain lines, phrases, stanzas. And that happens. Very much much of that happens in the moment when the poet realizes who that audience is and what that response is like, and so becomes a kind of a wave that you ride.",

I did my undergrad as part of my undergraduate studies I did in France and returned to the southern region for six months to work on a new book project, that's a bilingual French English smattering of Creole project about slavery and resistance in Louisiana, under the French colonial regime. So that's one project. And then there are two other poetry manuscripts. Also having to do with Louisiana with New Orleans as a topic with one of them does a lot of experimentation with rhyme, which I've never used, or never used to great effect before. I also write creative nonfiction. So there's a body of essays that I'm working on right now. And then there is a series of, I guess, for lack of a better word dispatches about my experiences returning to France, after all of those years, looking at French racism, which not only has not improved in the past 30 years, but has intensified and worsened in rather graphic ways.

        "value": "BMO: I think it fits perfectly, I think it's I think it's about as precise and as exact as we can get. I really think it is because it means a lot of different things at the same time. Of course, historically, we're an African people in the Americas. And there's so many versions and variations of that. And of course, there is a tendency to think of African American as a monolith, which, of course, it never is never was. And there has been a tendency, sometimes on the part of critics looking at my work to say, Well, this is not, this is not African American, this is not black, this is New Orleans. And and while New Orleans certainly has its own space, its own culture, that space in that culture have always been black space. And so it's one of those, one of the things that I always say is that when we make those kinds of distinctions, that slavery under the French was better or slavery under the Spaniards was better or slavery under the British, my slave masters better than your slave master never made any sense to me at all. We're talking about different experiences, we're talking about different cultural influences. We're talking about different different approaches to acquiring and claiming freedom. And a lot of that stuff is contained in language. And in part, there's a very practical side to that a lot of that is contained in language, because law is written in language. [laughter] And so once you have the black codes promulgated in the French, Caribbean, and later in Louisiana, that sets the tone for how freedom will be denied and claimed and bartered against. And so certainly African American, I think entirely fits who I am and what I do. But the other thing that I think is that when we look at the Americans, in the broader sense, the things that we single out, as having uniquely to do with the Americas, as opposed to those things having to do with Europe, those things having to do with Africa. What we're looking at is the influence of people of African descent in the new world. And I don't think we yet realize the hugeness of that reality. I don't think we yet understand what that means. When Ever American culture is transported, what is transported and what is received is something that is black in its origins. And that's something that I think we need to be very clear about stating and laying claim to and making clear for ourselves, because I think we often are not aware of the extent of our influence in the culture. And I think in part, it's because the United States in particular is such a large space geographically, in such a broad space, culturally, that it's easy for us not to look beyond the boundaries of the 48 states. But once we step outside of that, and we begin to look at cultures across the world, things begin to make much more sense to us. And our role in the world begins to make much more sense to us, and how we are depicted and represented, and how we are written about and spoken about, and how we claim the language and languages in which we will write about our own selves, and our own experiences. Those are the things that actually signify America and the Americas in terms of culture, and terms of cultural transmissions. And I think that maybe it's a little bit easier for poets to be aware of that, because I think poets may have a tendency to read across genres and across languages, much more so than other folk, it isn't uncommon for poets to be bilingually, or trilingually, or at least to work with bilingual texts, it isn't. It isn't as unusual perhaps for us to do that. And to work with translators of our work, it isn't uncommon that translations of prose fiction occur without any participation by the author. It's somewhat rare that such translations occur without the participation of the poet. That's somewhat rare, actually.",
